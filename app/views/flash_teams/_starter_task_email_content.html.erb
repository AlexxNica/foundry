					<p>This is an email from the Stanford HCI Group regarding your interest in joining our  <%=@task_member%> panel. We are excited to hear you are interested in working with us!</p>
					<p>
					In order to join the panel, we request that you complete a starter task to make sure that you have the skills and experiences needed to complete the types of tasks that will be made available. Once you complete the starter task, we will review your deliverable and make a decision. If you are invited to join the panel, you will receive a link to access the panel on boarding and confirm your membership. At that point, you will start receiving jobs as they become available.
					</p>
					<p>
					The starter task is designed to also give you exposure and experience with Foundry, our workflow management and collaboration platform. The information about the project, your starter task and compensation for your time is below. Once you accept the task, you will be taken to Foundry, which will provide you with more information.
